  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for administrative access
  - Session management with automatic timeout

- **Audit and Accountability (AU)**
  - Comprehensive logging of all system events
  - Centralized log management with 90-day retention
  - Regular audit trail reviews

- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**
  - TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
  - Network segmentation between services
  - API Gateway with rate limiting and DDoS protection

## HIPAA Compliance

### Protected Health Information (PHI) Protection
- **Technical Safeguards**
  - Encryption at rest for all PHI data
  - Secure transmission protocols
  - Access controls with audit logging

- **Administrative Safeguards**
  - Regular security risk assessments
  - Employee training on PHI handling
  - Incident response procedures

## GDPR Compliance
